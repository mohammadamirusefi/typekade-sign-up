#  Typekadeh Auto Register

##  Overview

This project is an **automation script** built with **Python** and **Selenium** that automatically registers a new account on [Typekadeh](https://typekadeh.com).

It opens the website in a browser, fills in the registration form (name, email, password, etc.), and submits it automatically — just like a real user would.

It was created for learning purposes — to explore web automation and browser control with Python.
